    Finds the rotation that takes [001] to a given zone axis.

    Parameters
    ----------
    structure : diffpy.structure.structure.Structure
        The structure for which a rotation needs to be found.
    direction : array like
        [UVW] direction that the 'z' axis should end up point down.

    This implementation works with an axis arrangement that has +x as
    left to right, +y as bottom to top and +z as out of the plane of a
