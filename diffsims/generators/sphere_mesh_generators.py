    vectors from the origin to these grid points are normalized to unit
    length. The grid on the cube can be generated in three ways, see
    `grid_type` and reference [Cajaravelli2015]_.

    Parameters
    ----------
    resolution : float
        The maximum angle in degrees between first nearest neighbor grid
        points.
    grid_type : str
        The type of cube grid, can be either `normalized` or `spherified_edge`
        or `spherified_corner` (default). For details see notes.

    Returns
    -------
    points_in_cartesian : numpy.ndarray (N,3)
        Rows are x, y, z where z is the 001 pole direction

    Notes
    -----
    The resolution determines the maximum angle between first nearest
    neighbor grid points, but to get an integer number of points between the
    cube face center and the edges, the number of grid points is rounded up.
    In practice this means that resolution is always an upper limit.
    Additionally, where on the grid this maximum angle will be will depend
    on the type of grid chosen. Resolution says something about the maximum
    angle but nothing about the distribution of nearest neighbor angles or
    the minimum angle - also this is fixed by the chosen grid.

    In the normalized grid, the grid on the surface of the cube is linear.
    The maximum angle between nearest neighbors is found between the <001>
    directions and the first grid point towards the <011> directions. Points
    approaching the edges and corners of the cube will have a smaller angular
    deviation, so orientation space will be oversampled there compared to the
    cube faces <001>.

    In the spherified_edge grid, the grid is constructed so that there
    are still two sets of perpendicular grid lines parallel to the {100}
    directions on each cube face, but the spacing of the grid lines is
    chosen so that the angles between the grid points on the line
    connecting the face centers (<001>) to the edges (<011>) are equal.
    The maximum angle is also between the <001> directions and the first
    grid point towards the <011> edges. This grid slightly oversamples the
    directions between <011> and <111>

    The spherified_corner case is similar to the spherified_edge case, but
    the spacing of the grid lines is chosen so that the angles between
    the grid points on the line connecting the face centers to the cube
    corners (<111>) is equal. The maximum angle in this grid is from the
    corners to the first grid point towards the cube face centers.
