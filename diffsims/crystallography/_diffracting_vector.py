class DiffractingVector(ReciprocalLatticeVector):
    r"""Reciprocal lattice vectors :math:`(hkl)` for use in electron
    diffraction analysis and simulation.

    All lengths are assumed to be given in Å or inverse Å.

    This extends the :class:`ReciprocalLatticeVector` class.  `DiffractingVector`
    focus on the subset of reciprocal lattice vectors that are relevant for
    electron diffraction based on the intersection of the Ewald sphere with the
    reciprocal lattice.

    This class is only used internally to store the DiffractionVectors generated from the
    :class:`~diffsims.simulations.DiffractionSimulation` class. It is not (currently)
    intended to be used directly by the user.

    Parameters
    ----------
    phase : orix.crystal_map.Phase
        A phase with a crystal lattice and symmetry.
    xyz : numpy.ndarray, list, or tuple, optional
        Cartesian coordinates of indices of reciprocal lattice vector(s)
        ``hkl``. Default is ``None``. This, ``hkl``, or ``hkil`` is
        required.
    hkl : numpy.ndarray, list, or tuple, optional
        Indices of reciprocal lattice vector(s). Default is ``None``.
        This, ``xyz``, or ``hkil`` is required.
    hkil : numpy.ndarray, list, or tuple, optional
        Indices of reciprocal lattice vector(s), often preferred over
        ``hkl`` in trigonal and hexagonal lattices. Default is ``None``.
        This, ``xyz``, or ``hkl`` is required.
    intensity : numpy.ndarray, list, or tuple, optional
        Intensity of the diffraction vector(s). Default is ``None``.
    rotation : orix.quaternion.Rotation, optional
        Rotation matrix previously applied to the reciprocal lattice vector(s) and the
        lattice of the phase. Default is ``None`` which corresponds to the
        identity matrix.

            are rotated by the given rotation.

        Notes
        -----
        Rotating the lattice basis may lead to undefined behavior in orix as it violates
        the assumption that the basis is aligned with the crystal axes. Particularly,
        applying symmetry operations to the phase may lead to unexpected results.
